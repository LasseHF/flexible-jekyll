I am currently working on a vertical slice game demo with a team from The National Film School of Denmark. The game is being developed in Unreal Engine 4 and will be finished in May 2020. I am doing sound design, music and audio implementation in Wwise on the project. This is an early prototype scene from the upcoming game.
