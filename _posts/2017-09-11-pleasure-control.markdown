The party organizing crew [Pleasure Control][pleasure-control] threw a party at the club [Ved Siden Af][ved-siden-af] in the fall of 2018, for which they gathered a group of artists to do different installations. For this event I made a generative and interactive composition that played in the lounge area throughout the entire night. 

The lighting designer working with me in the lounge had hung a curly reflective material from the ceiling, on which a projector cast moving colours (see picture). To play off of the changing and colourful light refractions of this installation, I decided to make the expression of the composition glitchy and flickering.

To interact with the composition, the partygoers could shine the light from their cell phones through a hole in the wall, inside which I had installed a light sensitive sensor that was connected to an Arduino that send the data to my computer on which the composition was running. Doing this activated different audio effects, affecting the sounds in the composition.

This video was used as a teaser for the generative composition before the party. Underneath is a longer recording of the composition.
