As part of my education at DADIU (The National Academy of Digital Interactive Entertainment), I worked on a video game called “The Little Mermaid”. The game was designed as a supplement to a new release of the classic story by H.C. Andersen, illustrated by Peter Madsen. By playing as the Little Mermaid as she rescues the shipwrecked prince, the game should give the player an experience of unfolding a part of the story.

I did the entirety of the audio work on this project, which included sound design, music, mix, VO recording and editing and implementation with Wwise and Unity/C#.
