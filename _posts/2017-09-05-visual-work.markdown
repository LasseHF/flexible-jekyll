Besides working with sound, I also enjoy programming visuals in Jitter. On this site are a couple of examples of said visuals.

<strong>Pleasure Control - Lighting installation</strong>

For the Pleasure Control party at Ved Siden Af [(for which I also made a generative and interactive composition)][generative], I made a light installation for the dancefloor. Under direction of two lighting designers I programmed generative visuals in Jitter, which were then projected into the room.

This video is a recording of the first iteration of the visuals. Watch in full screen to avoid flickering.

I eventually decided to simplify the visuals quite a lot. The projections that resulted from this can be seen in these gifs.

<strong>Helium - Music video</strong>


I made a music video for the song Helium by [Skyskraber][skyskraber] – a band in which I played myself. The main idea was to have a psychedelic screen-saver like vibe with an audio reactive element. The visuals for the video are programmed in Jitter.
