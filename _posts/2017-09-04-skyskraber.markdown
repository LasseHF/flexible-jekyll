[Skyskraber][skyskraber] is an indierock band in which I composed, arranged and produced all songs, played guitar and sang. In many ways the work with Skyskraber was what got me started with sound design and composition. Here you can hear the last songs we released before dissolving the band and see some of our music videos.
