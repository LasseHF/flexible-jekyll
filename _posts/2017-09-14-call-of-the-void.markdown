Call Of The Void is a project I did with two game designer from The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts Schools of Architecture, Design and Conservation. I did the entirety of the audio work on the game which included sound design, music, foley and field recording, VO recording, and implementation with Wwise and Unity/C#.
