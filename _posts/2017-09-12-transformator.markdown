I was invited to make a suggestion for a jingle for the podcast series “Transformator” by the media group [Ingeniøren][ingeniøren]. The programs focus on news about technology and science, and discus how they change our world and society. I was asked to make the jingle sound “machine-like” and “digital” while still being pleasant. Underneath you can here the jingle and four breakers I made.
