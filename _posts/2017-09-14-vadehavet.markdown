During my employment at [No Parking Production][noparking], I did the sound design and music for a [permanent installation for Vadehavescenteret][vadehavet]. The sound is composed for a quadraphonic speaker setup and accompanies stories told with projected animations that move around the walls of the room. The sound in the documentation video is a rework of a section of the composition.
