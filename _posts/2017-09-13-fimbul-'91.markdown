As part of my education at DADIU (The National Academy of Digital Interactive Entertainment), I worked on the video game “Fimbul ’91”.

The game has you playing as a reincarnation of the norse god of mischief, Loki, who is looking to release ragnarok in 1991.

I did the entirety of the audio work on this project, which included sound design, music foley, mix, VO recording and editing and implementation with Wwise and Unity/C#.
