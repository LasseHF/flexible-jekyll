As part of my education at DADIU (The National Academy of Digital Interactive Entertainment), I did the sound design and music for a video game called “The Little Mermaid”. The game was designed as a supplement to a new release of the classic story by H.C. Andersen, illustrated by Peter Madsen. By playing as the Little Mermaid as she rescues the shipwrecked prince, the game should give the player an experience of unfolding a part of the story.

I did the entirety of the audio work on this project, which included music, sound design, mix and implementation with Wwise. The game was created with the Unity engine.
